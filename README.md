# Chaos in a Three-Species Food Chain
Replication of the 1991 paper by Hastings and Powell (https://doi.org/10.2307/1940591) for the course Mathematical Biology (University of Trento), including an implementation of the 0-1 test developed by Gottwald and Melbourne (2016, https://talus.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/gottwald/preprints/testforchaos_MPI.pdf). For the methodology, we also refer to the 2020 reproduction paper by Dansereau et al. (https://rescience.github.io/bibliography/Dansereau_2020.html). Some of the code was written with the help of Gemini Pro 3.
