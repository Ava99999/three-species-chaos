Replication of the [1991]([url](https://doi.org/10.2307/1940591)) paper by Hastings and Powell for the course Mathematical Biology (University of Trento), including an implementation of the 0-1 test developed by Gottwald and Melbourne ([2016]([url](https://talus.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/gottwald/preprints/testforchaos_MPI.pdf))). For the methodology, we also refer to the [2020]([url](https://rescience.github.io/bibliography/Dansereau_2020.html)) reproduction paper by Dansereau et al.
